# Smart-Bin

This project uses ESP32 and HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor along with load sensor to determine the volume and weight of trash in the garbage bin.
This data can be used to optimize the paths of waste collection vehicles and increase the efficiency of logistical operations in waste management processes.
